         <p>Hey, I'm Mike, a Software Engineer based in New York City. I'm currently working on <a href="https://github.com/open-source-labs/nautilus#readme" target="_blank">Nautilus</a>, a developer tool that dynamically renders essential Docker Compose properties onto an Electron GUI in order to ease the development process.</p>
         <br> 
         <p>In a previous life, I was a Sleep Technologist, and worked at a sleep lab to collect and analyze biophysiological data to aid in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. As a former clinician, <strong>I care deeply about the intersection between Health and Technology</strong>, and I believe that Tech has the power to enable distributed healthcare and empower individuals to be more informed about their health.</p>
         <br>
         <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading Manga, watching Movies, and Powerlifting.</p>
